            I'm a front-end focused software engineer with over 3 years experience, and my
            background also includes cloud development and network engineering.

            As a consultant, I've worked on large scale applications for companies such as Home
            Depot and NCR as well as for various smaller scale companies.

            Before pursuing a career in tech, I traveled around the Americas, Europe, and Asia while
            day-trading.

            I'm passionate about exploring everything I can learn, especially front end development
            and the latest technologies. Outside of coding, my interests include stand-up comedy,
            offset bbq smoking, and hiking in nature.

            For the last two years I've been helping family in South Georgia where we have a farm
            and pecan orchard. I also helped start a local pecan butter business.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently looking for a remote front-end opportunity at a growing company to add
            value while continuing to expand my engineering and leadership skills.
